# GitHub Pages URL Shortner

Inspired by & copied from [nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener), but changed in a way so that the links are read from repository files instead of the issues' IDs & titles so that:

1. You won't need to be worry about unauthorized/spam link creation
2. You can take advantage of custom short link (e.g. [ln.yash.im/src](https://ln.yash.im/src))

Kudos to the main repo, awesome idea & implementation.
